### Hi there, I'm [Behrooz Azarkhalili](https://twitter.com/Azarkhalili) 👋


I'm a data scientist working on the applications of deep learning on computational drug discovery and computational protemics as a researcher in the [Mofrad Group](https://llp.berkeley.edu/people/) at the University of California, Berkeley.

- 🧠 I’m currently working on democratizing Deep Learning for the Life Sciences with [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem), [Tensoflow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch), [Hugginface](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp), [DGL](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl). I am working on developing sequence and graph based models for understanding computational protemics and structural biology.
- 🔬 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Hugginface](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp), [Deep Graph Library](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl). 
- ⚙️ I am exploiting `Python`, `Tensorflow`, `Pytorch`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Pandas`, `Transformers`, and `DGL`.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning for computational biology and chemistry.
- 💬 Ask me about DL, NLP and Computational Chemistry.
