# GitHub Actions Status Report

## Overview
This document provides a status report of GitHub Actions workflows in this repository and documents known issues and their resolutions.

## Current Workflows

### ✅ Waka Readme Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/Waka-Readme.yml`
- **Purpose**: Updates README with WakaTime coding statistics
- **Schedule**: Daily at 7 AM UTC (midnight PDT)
- **Status**: Operational with resilience improvements

## Historical Issues

### GitHub GraphQL API Timeouts (Resolved)
**Issue Period**: August 17-18, 2025  
**Total Failures**: 64 workflow runs

**Root Cause**: 
The WakaTime action was failing with 504 timeout errors when querying GitHub's GraphQL API for commit data:
```
Exception: Query 'repo_commit_list' failed to run by returning code of 504: 
{'message': "We couldn't respond to your request in time. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact us if the problem persists."}
```

**Resolution Applied**:
1. Added `timeout-minutes: 15` to prevent indefinite hanging
2. Added `continue-on-error: true` to allow graceful failure handling
3. Added `strategy.fail-fast: false` for better error resilience
4. Added informative error handling step to explain temporary failures
5. Added descriptive step names for better debugging

**Current Status**: ✅ Resolved - Workflow has been running successfully since August 19, 2025

## Recommendations

### For Repository Maintainers
1. **Monitor workflow runs** regularly in the Actions tab
2. **Check failure patterns** - isolated failures are usually transient API issues
3. **Update dependencies** periodically, especially the WakaTime action
4. **Consider alternatives** if persistent failures occur:
   - Switch to a more reliable WakaTime action
   - Reduce data collection scope
   - Implement custom retry logic

### For Contributors
- GitHub Actions failures for the WakaTime workflow don't affect:
  - Code contributions
  - Pull request checks
  - Repository functionality
- These are purely cosmetic README updates

## Troubleshooting

### If WakaTime Workflow Fails
1. Check if it's an isolated incident (single failure)
2. Look for 504 timeout errors in logs
3. Wait for next scheduled run (daily at 7 AM UTC)
4. If failures persist for >3 days, consider manual workflow dispatch

### Manual Workflow Trigger
You can manually trigger the WakaTime workflow:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Waka Readme" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select main branch and click "Run workflow"
