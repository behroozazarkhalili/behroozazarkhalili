# GitHub Actions Status Report

## Overview
This document provides a status report of GitHub Actions workflows in this repository and documents known issues and their resolutions.

## Current Workflows

### ✅ Waka Readme Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/Waka-Readme.yml`
- **Purpose**: Updates README with WakaTime coding statistics
- **Schedule**: Daily at 7 AM UTC (midnight PDT)
- **Status**: Operational with resilience improvements

## Historical Issues

### GitHub GraphQL API Timeouts (Resolved)
**Issue Period**: August 17-18, 2025  
**Total Failures**: 64 workflow runs

**Root Cause**: 
The WakaTime action was failing with 504 timeout errors when querying GitHub's GraphQL API for commit data:
```
Exception: Query 'repo_commit_list' failed to run by returning code of 504: 
{'message': "We couldn't respond to your request in time. Sorry about that. Please try resubmitting your request and contact us if the problem persists."}
```

**Resolution Applied**:
1. ✅ Added `timeout-minutes: 20` to prevent indefinite hanging (increased from 15 for retry attempts)
2. ✅ Added `continue-on-error: true` to allow graceful failure handling
3. ✅ Added `strategy.fail-fast: false` for better error resilience
4. ✅ Pinned action to stable version `V4.1.0` instead of unstable `@master`
5. ✅ **NEW**: Implemented intelligent 3-attempt retry mechanism with exponential backoff (60s, 120s delays)
6. ✅ **NEW**: Added comprehensive status reporting with detailed success/failure information
7. ✅ **NEW**: Enhanced error categorization and troubleshooting guidance
8. ✅ Added descriptive step names for better debugging

**Current Status**: ✅ Enhanced - Workflow now includes intelligent retry logic and comprehensive error handling (Updated August 20, 2025)

## Recommendations

### For Repository Maintainers
1. **Monitor workflow runs** regularly in the Actions tab
2. **Check failure patterns** - isolated failures are usually transient API issues
3. **Review retry outcomes** - the workflow now attempts 3 tries with intelligent backoff
4. **Update dependencies** periodically, especially the WakaTime action (currently pinned to V4.1.0)
5. **Consider alternatives** if persistent failures occur (>3 consecutive days of all-retry failures):
   - Switch to a more reliable WakaTime action
   - Reduce data collection scope
   - Implement manual workflow triggers during off-peak hours

### For Contributors
- GitHub Actions failures for the WakaTime workflow don't affect:
  - Code contributions
  - Pull request checks
  - Repository functionality
- These are purely cosmetic README updates

## Troubleshooting

### If WakaTime Workflow Fails
1. **Check retry status** - the workflow automatically attempts up to 3 tries with intelligent delays
2. **Identify failure type**:
   - Single attempt failure: Usually transient, next retry likely to succeed
   - All 3 attempts failed: Likely persistent API issue or service degradation
3. **For persistent failures** (all retries exhausted):
   - Check GitHub Status page for API incidents
   - Wait for next scheduled run (daily at 7 AM UTC)
   - Consider manual trigger during off-peak hours
4. **If failures persist for >3 consecutive days**, consider investigating alternative solutions

### Manual Workflow Trigger
You can manually trigger the WakaTime workflow:
1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Waka Readme" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select main branch and click "Run workflow"
